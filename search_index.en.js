To govern their behavior and fulfill their jobs, these systems rely on firmware programming. Writing efficient firmware code, on the other hand, is a difficult undertaking. It necessitates a thorough understanding of hardware constraints, software algorithms, and optimization strategies. This blog article will look at some best practices for designing efficient embedded firmware code. These strategies will not only increase your system's performance and dependability but will also lower production costs and time-to-market. Let's get started!\nIncreasing the efficiency of embedded firmware development\nEmbedded systems are often built with limited resources such as memory, computing power, and battery life. Optimizing the firmware development process with this in mind is therefore critical for success. Here are some pointers for increasing productivity in embedded firmware development:\nUse efficient algorithms to reduce code runtime and memory utilization\nChoosing efficient algorithms is critical for reducing code runtime and memory consumption. This can help you save resources in the long term, extending the life of your system.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\n\n// Function to find the sum of all elements in an array\nint sum(int arr[], int size) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) {\n        result += arr[i];\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Create an array with 10,000 elements\n    int arr[10000];\n\n    // Seed the random number generator\n    srand(time(NULL));\n\n    // Initialize the array with random integers\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; ++i) {\n        arr[i] = rand();\n    }\n\n    // Measure the time it takes to compute the sum using a for loop\n    clock_t start1 = clock();\n    int result1 = sum(arr, 10000);\n    clock_t end1 = clock();\n    double time1 = (double)(end1 - start1) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC * 1000000;\n\n    // Measure the time it takes to compute the sum using the reduce function\n    clock_t start2 = clock();\n    int result2 = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; ++i) {\n        result2 += arr[i];\n    }\n    clock_t end2 = clock();\n    double time2 = (double)(end2 - start2) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC * 1000000;\n\n    // Print the results\n    printf(\"Sum: %d\\n\", result1);\n    printf(\"Time using for loop: %f microseconds\\n\", time1);\n    printf(\"Time using reduce function: %f microseconds\\n\", time2);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we create an array with 10,000 elements and initialize it with random integers. We then measure the time it takes to compute the sum of all elements in the array using two different methods: a for loop and a reduce function. We then compare the results and print the time taken by each method.\nBy comparing the results of the two methods, we can see that using the reduce function (which is essentially an optimized for loop) is faster than using a regular for loop. This is because the reduce function is implemented using a more efficient algorithm, which reduces code runtime and memory consumption.\nBy using efficient algorithms like the reduce function, we can reduce code runtime and memory consumption, which can help us save resources in the long term and extend the life of our embedded systems.\nReduce the utilization of cycles in inner loops and key sections\nReducing the number of cycles used in inner loops and crucial portions can significantly increase your system's processing speed and overall performance.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    // Create a 2D array with dimensions 1000 x 1000\n    int arr[1000][1000];\n\n    // Initialize the array with random integers\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; ++j) {\n            arr[i][j] = i + j;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compute the sum of all elements in the array\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; ++j) {\n            sum += arr[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the sum\n    printf(\"Sum: %d\\n\", sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we create a 2D array with dimensions 1000 x 1000 and initialize it with random integers. We then compute the sum of all elements in the array using two nested for loops.\nWhile this approach is correct, it can be optimized to reduce the number of cycles used in the inner loop. We can achieve this by transposing the 2D array before computing the sum, so that the inner loop becomes a contiguous memory access, which is much faster than non-contiguous access.\nHere's the optimized version of the program:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    // Create a 2D array with dimensions 1000 x 1000\n    int arr[1000][1000];\n\n    // Initialize the array with random integers\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; ++j) {\n            arr[i][j] = i + j;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Transpose the array\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n        for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; 1000; ++j) {\n            int temp = arr[i][j];\n            arr[i][j] = arr[j][i];\n            arr[j][i] = temp;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compute the sum of all elements in the array\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; ++j) {\n            sum += arr[i][j];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the sum\n    printf(\"Sum: %d\\n\", sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this optimized version of the program, we first transpose the 2D array before computing the sum. This reduces the number of cycles used in the inner loop, which significantly increases the processing speed and overall performance of the system.\nOptimize hardware access to reduce system latency\nOptimizing hardware access is critical for lowering system latency, which can assist in boosting your system's overall performance.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\n\n// Memory-mapped I/O registers\n#define GPIO_DIR   (*(volatile unsigned int *)0x80000000)\n#define GPIO_DATA  (*(volatile unsigned int *)0x80000004)\n\nint main() {\n    // Set the direction of the GPIO pins to output\n    GPIO_DIR = 0xFFFF;\n\n    // Generate random data to write to the GPIO pins\n    srand(time(NULL));\n    unsigned int data = rand() &amp; 0xFFFF;\n\n    // Write the data to the GPIO pins\n    GPIO_DATA = data;\n\n    // Delay for a short period to simulate latency\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {}\n\n    // Read the data from the GPIO pins\n    unsigned int read_data = GPIO_DATA;\n\n    // Check if the read data matches the written data\n    (read_data == data) ? \n        printf(\"Data matched\\n\") : \n        printf(\"Data did not match\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we use memory-mapped I/O registers to access the GPIO pins of the system. We first set the direction of the GPIO pins to output and generate random data to write to the pins. We then write the data to the pins and delay for a short period to simulate latency.\nAfter the delay, we read the data from the GPIO pins and check if it matches the written data. If the read data matches the written data, we print a message indicating success. Otherwise, we print a message indicating failure.\nTo optimize hardware access and reduce system latency, we can use direct memory access (DMA) to transfer data between the system's memory and the hardware peripherals. This can significantly reduce the latency and increase the overall performance of the system.\nImplement interrupt handlers efficiently\nTo avoid slowing down the system unnecessarily, interrupt handlers should be constructed with minimum delay and used only when essential.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;signal.h&gt;\n#include &lt;time.h&gt;\n\nvolatile int counter = 0;\n\nvoid handler(int signum) {\n    // Increment the counter variable\n    counter++;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Register the signal handler for the SIGALRM signal\n    signal(SIGALRM, handler);\n\n    // Set a timer to send the SIGALRM signal every 1 millisecond\n    struct itimerval timer;\n    timer.it_value.tv_sec = 0;\n    timer.it_value.tv_usec = 1000;\n    timer.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;\n    timer.it_interval.tv_usec = 1000;\n    setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &amp;timer, NULL);\n\n    // Run a loop that performs a computation\n    while (1) {\n        // Perform a computation that takes some time\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {}\n\n        // Check if the counter variable has been incremented\n        if (counter &gt; 0) {\n            printf(\"Interrupt occurred\\n\");\n\n            // Reset the counter variable\n            counter = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we use a signal handler to handle the SIGALRM signal, which is sent by a timer every 1 millisecond. The signal handler simply increments a counter variable.\nWe then run a loop that performs a computation that takes some time. During this computation, the system can receive interrupts, which can slow down the computation and increase the latency.\nTo avoid slowing down the system unnecessarily, we check if the counter variable has been incremented during the computation. If an interrupt occurred, we print a message indicating that an interrupt occurred and reset the counter variable.\nBy constructing the interrupt handler with minimum delay and using it only when essential, we can reduce the impact of interrupts on the system's performance and improve its efficiency.\nIncrease code reuse and modular architecture\nIncreasing code reuse and establishing a modular architecture can assist in reducing redundancy and, as a result, enhance system maintainability over time.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n// Declare a function that calculates the sum of two integers\nint sum(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n// Declare a function that calculates the difference between two integers\nint difference(int a, int b) {\n    return a - b;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare two integers\n    int x = 5;\n    int y = 3;\n\n    // Calculate the sum of x and y\n    int s = sum(x, y);\n\n    // Calculate the difference between x and y\n    int d = difference(x, y);\n\n    // Print the results\n    printf(\"Sum: %d\\n\", s);\n    printf(\"Difference: %d\\n\", d);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we declare two functions sum and difference that calculate the sum and difference of two integers, respectively. By declaring these functions, we increase code reuse and establish a modular architecture, since we can use these functions in other parts of the code.\nWe then declare two integers x and y, calculate the sum of x and y using the sum function, and calculate the difference between x and y using the difference function. Finally, we print the results.\nBy increasing code reuse and establishing a modular architecture, we reduce redundancy and enhance system maintainability over time, which can lead to more efficient firmware code in embedded systems.\nOptimizing code size for embedded systems\nWhen developing firmware for embedded systems, it's critical to keep the device's limited memory and processing capability in mind. Consider the following while optimizing the firmware code for size:\nUse compiler optimization flags\nModern compilers provide optimization features to reduce code size and improve execution speed. Use these flags to reduce the size and execution time of your code.\ngcc -O my_program.c -o my_program\nAlternatively, we can use specific optimization flags to optimize for code size (-Os) or execution speed (-O3).\ngcc -Os my_program.c -o my_program\ngcc -O3 my_program.c -o my_program\nUnderstand and reduce the use of global variables and functions\nGlobal variables and functions can increase the size of your code in case used ineffectively, so use them wisely. Instead, whenever possible, use local variables and static functions. Someone can also go for inline functions or reduce functions to expressions.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n// Declare a static function to print a message\nstatic void printMessage(const char* message) {\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", message);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare a local variable to store a message\n    const char* msg = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n    // Print the message using the static function\n    printMessage(msg);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nUse assembly language for critical sections\nThe use of assembly language can aid in the reduction of the size of essential sections of code while also enhancing execution time. This will also help you understand how the programming algorithm traverses the instructions. You can even gain a thorough understanding of the keywords or functions.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n// Declare an assembly function to add two numbers\nint asmAdd(int a, int b);\n\nint main() {\n    int x = 10;\n    int y = 20;\n\n    // Call the assembly function to add the two numbers\n    int sum = asmAdd(x, y);\n\n    printf(\"The sum of %d and %d is %d\\n\", x, y, sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n// Define the assembly function to add two numbers\nint asmAdd(int a, int b) {\n    int sum;\n    __asm__(\"add %[result], %[arg1], %[arg2]\"\n            : [result] \"=r\" (sum)\n            : [arg1] \"r\" (a), [arg2] \"r\" (b)\n           );\n    return sum;\n}\n\n\nEliminate unnecessary and dead code\nOn an embedded system, unnecessary and dead code can consume valuable memory. To reduce firmware size, remove any code that isn't needed to never run. This excludes any comments.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n#define ENABLE_FEATURE_1   1\n#define ENABLE_FEATURE_2   0\n#define ENABLE_FEATURE_3   1\n\nvoid feature1() {\n    printf(\"This is Feature 1\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid feature2() {\n    printf(\"This is Feature 2\\n\");\n}\n\nvoid feature3() {\n    printf(\"This is Feature 3\\n\");\n}\n\nint main() {\n    #if ENABLE_FEATURE_1\n        feature1();\n    #endif\n\n    #if ENABLE_FEATURE_2\n        feature2();\n    #endif\n\n    #if ENABLE_FEATURE_3\n        feature3();\n    #endif\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this example, we have three feature functions - feature1, feature2, and feature3. We also have three #define macros - ENABLE_FEATURE_1, ENABLE_FEATURE_2, and ENABLE_FEATURE_3 that determine which features should be enabled in the firmware. By selectively enabling/disabling these macros, we can remove any unnecessary or dead code that is not needed.\nIn the main function, we use preprocessor directives #if and #endif to selectively call the feature functions based on the ENABLE macros. By enabling only the necessary features and disabling the others, we can significantly reduce the firmware size and optimize the code for efficient execution.\nConsider compression techniques\nData compression can help to reduce the amount of memory utilized for storage and communication on an embedded system.\nYou can ensure that your firmware runs smoothly on embedded devices without using too much memory or processing power by optimizing your code for size.\nYou can easily find open-source compression libraries like zlib for the compression and decompression of your data. The sample programs are also available in multiple forums or blogs.\nReducing power consumption with firmware optimization\nBecause embedded systems frequently run on batteries or limited power sources, power optimization is a critical factor in firmware development. Here are some recommendations for reducing power consumption through firmware optimization:\nOptimize processor utilization to reduce power consumption\nYou can reduce the stress on the processor and hence the power consumption by implementing efficient algorithms and eliminating the use of loops and instructions (as mentioned earlier). Additionally, using hardware acceleration can reduce the load on the processor, resulting in reduced power consumption.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n\n// Function to calculate the factorial of a number using hardware acceleration\nint factorial(int num) {\n    int result;\n    asm(\"MUL %1, %0\" : \"=r\"(result) : \"r\"(num)); // hardware multiplication instruction\n    return result;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int num = 5;\n    int fact = factorial(num);\n    printf(\"Factorial of %d is %d\\n\", num, fact);\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we have implemented the factorial function using hardware multiplication instruction instead of the traditional loop-based approach. This can significantly reduce the load on the processor and hence the power consumption.\nReduce data transfer overhead by using efficient communication protocols\nEfficient communication protocols can also save energy by reducing the amount of time the processor and other devices spend processing data. Reduce power consumption and enhance performance by using protocols such as USB or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).\nUse low-power modes when the system is idle or not in use\nUsing low-power modes when the system is idle can drastically cut power consumption. In this mode, the system disables unused or inactive peripherals and reduces their clock frequency to conserve power.\n#include &lt;msp430.h&gt;\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Initialize system\n    WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD; // Stop watchdog timer\n\n    P1DIR |= BIT0; // Set P1.0 as output\n\n    // Main loop\n    while (1) {\n        // Enter low power mode\n        __bis_SR_register(LPM0_bits + GIE);\n\n        // Wake up from low power mode\n        P1OUT ^= BIT0; // Toggle LED\n        __delay_cycles(1000000); // Delay for 1 second\n    }\n}\n\n// Interrupt service routine for timer\n#pragma vector = TIMER0_A0_VECTOR\n__interrupt void Timer_A (void) {\n    __bic_SR_register_on_exit(LPM0_bits); // Exit low power mode\n}\n\n\nIn this program, we are using the MSP430 microcontroller's low-power mode to conserve power when the system is idle. The __bis_SR_register(LPM0_bits + GIE) instruction puts the processor into LPM0 mode, which disables unused or inactive peripherals and reduces their clock frequency to conserve power. The __delay_cycles(1000000) function is used to simulate a delay of 1 second. When the timer interrupt occurs, the __bic_SR_register_on_exit(LPM0_bits) instruction wakes up the processor from low-power mode so that it can toggle an LED and then go back to low-power mode.\nMinimize the use of peripherals and sensors to conserve power\nWhile peripherals and sensors are required for the software to function, they contribute to the device's overall power consumption. Power consumption can be considerably reduced by reducing the use of peripherals and sensors.\nOptimize system clock speed to reduce power consumption without sacrificing performance\nThe system clock speed has a direct impact on power usage, You may balance performance and power consumption by adjusting the clock speed. To save energy, reduce the clock speed when performance is not necessary.\n#include &lt;avr/power.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    // Set the clock to 8 MHz\n    clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1);\n\n    // Perform some processing here\n\n    // Reduce the clock speed to 1 MHz to conserve power\n    clock_prescale_set(clock_div_8);\n\n    // Perform some low-power operations here\n\n    // Increase the clock speed back to 8 MHz for high-performance tasks\n    clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1);\n\n    // Perform some high-performance tasks here\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this example, we first set the clock speed to 8 MHz using the clock_prescale_set function from the avr/power.h library. We then perform some processing that requires high performance. After that, we reduce the clock speed to 1 MHz using the clock_prescale_set function again to conserve power. We then perform some low-power operations, followed by increasing the clock speed back to 8 MHz for high-performance tasks. Finally, we return 0 to indicate the successful execution of the program.\nTips for debugging embedded firmware issues\nUse hardware and software debugging real-time analysis and code tracing\nDebugging tools for hardware and software provide insight into system behavior, allowing you to trace code execution, monitor variables, and examine system performance in real-time. Use these tools in conjunction with manual testing to efficiently detect and resolve issues.\nI shall write a separate small article for this tip, yet you can find more information in the respective processor's datasheet or the reference manuals.\nUse logging and error reporting mechanisms to identify bugs and system crashes\nImplement logging and error reporting mechanisms to collect debug information about the system's behavior. Use this information to find probable flaws, exceptions, and system crashes. Consider including automated error reporting and telemetry tools to aid in debugging operations.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;errno.h&gt;\n\n// Define logging level macros\n#define LOG_INFO    0\n#define LOG_WARNING 1\n#define LOG_ERROR   2\n\n// Log function to write log messages to a file\nvoid log_msg(int level, const char* message) {\n    const char* level_str;\n\n    // Choose the appropriate log level string\n    switch (level) {\n        case LOG_INFO:\n            level_str = \"INFO\";\n            break;\n        case LOG_WARNING:\n            level_str = \"WARNING\";\n            break;\n        case LOG_ERROR:\n            level_str = \"ERROR\";\n            break;\n        default:\n            level_str = \"UNKNOWN\";\n    }\n\n    // Open the log file in append mode\n    FILE* log_file = fopen(\"mylog.txt\", \"a\");\n    if (log_file == NULL) {\n        // Report an error if the log file cannot be opened\n        printf(\"Error opening log file: %s\\n\", strerror(errno));\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Write the log message to the file\n    fprintf(log_file, \"[%s] %s\\n\", level_str, message);\n\n    // Close the log file\n    fclose(log_file);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Generate a random number between 0 and 99\n    int num = rand() % 100;\n\n    // Check if the number is greater than 50\n    if (num &gt; 50) {\n        // Log an informational message\n        log_msg(LOG_INFO, \"Number is greater than 50\");\n    } else if (num &gt; 25) {\n        // Log a warning message\n        log_msg(LOG_WARNING, \"Number is between 26 and 50\");\n    } else {\n        // Log an error message\n        log_msg(LOG_ERROR, \"Number is less than or equal to 25\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nThis program generates a random number and logs a message indicating whether the number is greater than 50, between 26 and 50, or less than or equal to 25. The log_msg() function writes log messages to a file named \"mylog.txt\" using the specified logging level. If an error occurs while opening the log file, an error message is printed to the console. This type of logging mechanism can be useful for detecting and resolving issues in embedded systems.\nPerform boundary testing and edge case analysis to identify and fix issues\nWhen inputs are at the limits of their defined range, boundary testing evaluates the system's behavior. Edge case testing assesses the system's performance when dealing with rare or extreme situations. These tests might discover hidden issues and assist you in ensuring the stability of your firmware.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n#define MIN_VALUE 0\n#define MAX_VALUE 10\n\nint main() {\n    int input;\n\n    printf(\"Enter a value between %d and %d: \", MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE);\n    scanf(\"%d\", &amp;input);\n\n    if (input &lt; MIN_VALUE) {\n        printf(\"Error: Input value is below the minimum range.\\n\");\n    } else if (input &gt; MAX_VALUE) {\n        printf(\"Error: Input value is above the maximum range.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Input value is within the range.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIn this program, the user is asked to enter a value within a specific range (defined by MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE). The input value is then checked against the range using boundary testing. If the input value is below the minimum value, an error message is displayed. Similarly, if the input value is above the maximum value, an error message is displayed. Otherwise, a message indicating that the input value is within the range is displayed. This program can help to ensure that the firmware behaves correctly when dealing with boundary conditions.\nImplement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to prevent system failures\nWhen your firmware encounters problems, it must handle them correctly in order to prevent system crashes and allow for graceful recovery. To ensure that your firmware can recover from unanticipated incidents, consider integrating retry mechanisms, fallback modes, and graceful degradation schemes.\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_RETRIES 5\n\nint main() {\n    int retries = 0;\n    int data = 0;\n\n    while (retries &lt; MAX_RETRIES) {\n        // Attempt to read data from a sensor\n        if (read_sensor_data(&amp;data) == SUCCESS) {\n            // Data was successfully read, process it\n            process_data(data);\n            break;  // Exit the loop\n        } else {\n            // Data read failed, retry after a delay\n            printf(\"Sensor read failed, retrying...\\n\");\n            retries++;\n            delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second before retrying\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (retries &gt;= MAX_RETRIES) {\n        // Maximum number of retries reached, enter fallback mode\n        printf(\"Sensor read failed after maximum retries, entering fallback mode...\\n\");\n        enter_fallback_mode();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint read_sensor_data(int *data) {\n    // Attempt to read data from a sensor\n    // Return SUCCESS if data was read successfully, otherwise return FAILURE\n}\n\nvoid process_data(int data) {\n    // Process the data read from the sensor\n}\n\nvoid enter_fallback_mode() {\n    // Enter fallback mode and perform necessary operations\n}\n\n\nIn this example, the program attempts to read data from a sensor and retries the operation if it fails. If the maximum number of retries is reached, the program enters fallback mode. This retry mechanism helps ensure that the firmware can recover from unexpected failures and continues to operate correctly.\nCollaborate with hardware engineers and vendors to identify and solve integration issues\nPoor hardware integration or hardware faults might cause firmware difficulties. Work with hardware engineers and manufacturers to ensure that your firmware interfaces correctly with the hardware components and peripherals. Comprehensive hardware documentation can assist you in streamlining the integration process and avoiding integration difficulties.\nConclusion\nFinally, writing efficient embedded firmware code necessitates a combination of experience, expertise, and meticulous planning. Developers can design code that runs quicker, uses less memory, and consumes less power by following the recommended practices suggested in this article without sacrificing functionality or dependability. These techniques can help you optimize your code and reduce the chance of errors or performance difficulties whether you are working on a small sensor or a complex embedded system. So, the next time you work on an embedded project, keep these principles in mind as you strive to create firmware that is both efficient and effective.\nBanner Image by macrovector on Freepik\n","id":"https://hexavik.github.io/posts/efficient-firmware-code-in-embedded-systems/","title":"How to write efficient firmware code"}},"docInfo":{"https://hexavik.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://hexavik.github.io/about/":{"body":426,"title":0},"https://hexavik.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hexavik.github.io/posts/code-test/":{"body":24,"title":4},"https://hexavik.github.io/posts/efficient-firmware-code-in-embedded-systems/":{"body":2537,"title":4}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
